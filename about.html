			Much of the first version of my CIS 155 project is the demonstration of my web development skills
			. This I show with constructing several elements in HTML then from there I modify or add styling 
			to those elements with CSS. In this version I exhibited knowledge of various selectors, the 
			means of linking pages, various style concepts such as inheritance and progressive enhancement. 
			With focus on good coding habbits.
		</p>
		<p id="Version2"></p>
			In version two of my project I implemented quite a few different things as well as made several enhancements to
			the existing code. Some of the changes I made involved floating different elements on my page to
			different positions and dealing with the subsequent container collapse. Other parts I 
			demonstrated consisted of things like using a background image, gradients and the use of image 
			maps.
		</p>
		<p id="Version3">
			In version three I decided to add in another page and subsequent style sheet. Within that page 
			I build a table of a few of Krylon's spray paint colors. Aside from the table element some styling
			was done to the page for aestetic purposes, as well as, to match up with the other pages and assist
			in creating a sense of uniformity.
		</p>
		<p id="Version4">
			Version four of my project consisted of adding several elements to the Resources page. I also used 
			CSS to create a shifting color animation for the background of the Resources page. The elements I 
			added to this page were a sound clip of a spraypaint can spraying with the controls visible. I also 
			added a inset window of the Home page, this was more of an experiment than a feature of the page I 
			would like to link in a retailer's web site in this spot but must receive permission before hand. The 
			Final part I added was an artist registration form.
		</p>
	<!--<article id="about_article">
		<p>
			Artwork is an important part of any culture. To me spray paint art has been a long opressed form. This
			isnt for wrong or bad reasons either. The most know spray paint "Art" is the gross gang writing that 
			we are forced to see all over. That being said, I disregard ALL gang related spray paintings as nothing
			 more than garbage. The image used for this article's background is a perfect example of what I am trying
			 to share. Enjoy!
